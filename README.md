# 🧠 COMMAND OVERLOAD

A high-intensity, JARVIS-style dashboard game where players fight cognitive overload by completing tasks faster than the system can collapse.

---

## 🎮 Overview

**COMMAND OVERLOAD** is a real-time task-execution game built around a single idea:

> What if a futuristic AI dashboard kept assigning you tasks faster than any human can comfortably handle?

The player operates a comprehensive sci-fi control interface composed of interactive task tiles. At the same time, an **Alert Queue** continuously fills with system problems that must be cleared using the appropriate tile.

Alerts never stop coming.

Your job is not to complete everything —  
your job is to prevent the system from collapsing.

On the surface, the game feels chaotic and fast-paced.  
Underneath, it is a strategic test of attention, prioritization, and decision-making under pressure.

---

## 🧍 Player Role

You are not playing a character.  
You are operating a system that is actively overwhelming you.

The dashboard feels powerful, clean, and futuristic — but it is hostile by volume, not by difficulty.

The challenge comes from:

- Multitasking  
- Prioritization  
- Fast comprehension  
- Controlled execution under pressure  

---

## 🖥️ Dashboard (Main Play Area)

The entire game takes place on one evolving dashboard screen.

### Layout

- Modular task tiles (primary interaction)
- Persistent alert queue (pressure source)
- System status indicators  
  - Load  
  - Stability  
  - Failure Risk  

The UI is intentionally dense but readable, inspired by futuristic command interfaces.

## 🧩 Task Tiles (Core Gameplay)

Each tile represents a type of cognitive or physical interaction.  
Tiles are always visible and reusable — alerts specify:

- Which tile to use  
- What objective to complete  
- How urgent the task is  

### Task Types

#### ⌨️ Typing Tasks
- Type commands or short sequences  
- Speed and accuracy matter  
- Mistakes increase system load  

#### 🧲 Drag & Drop Tasks
- Reorder items  
- Connect components  
- Move elements into correct zones  

#### 🔀 Sorting Tasks
- Sort by priority, color, size, frequency, or logic  
- Rules may subtly change over time  

#### 🎯 Precision Tasks
- Track moving targets  
- Align sliders  
- Stabilize drifting controls  

#### 🎙️ Voice Tasks (Optional)
- Speak short commands  
- Pronunciation and timing matter  

#### 🔗 Connection Tasks
- Link nodes  
- Complete circuits  
- Restore relationships between elements  

Each task is simple in isolation.  
Difficulty emerges from volume, overlap, and time pressure.

## 🚨 Alert System (Pressure Engine)

Alerts are generated continuously and stacked inside the Alert Queue.

Each alert includes:

- Required task tile  
- Specific objective  
- Time sensitivity  

An alert is cleared only by completing its task.

Ignored alerts:

- Increase system load  
- Can overlap or chain  
- Continue escalating  

Alerts never pause.

---

## ⚠️ System Overload & Failure

The system has a load threshold.

Load increases when:

- Alerts stack too high  
- Tasks are completed incorrectly  
- The player over-focuses on one task type  

At critical load:

- UI glitches  
- Input delays increase  
- Alerts may duplicate  

At maximum overload:


The run ends.

---

## 🧠 The Hidden Game

Although it feels like a reaction game, the real skills tested are:

- Selective attention  
- Task prioritization  
- Rapid context switching  
- Knowing when to abandon a task  

Doing everything perfectly is impossible.

Winning means:

> Doing the right things at the right time — and letting the rest fail gracefully.

---

## 🔄 Difficulty Scaling

Difficulty does **not** come from harder tasks.

It comes from:

- Faster alert generation  
- Mixed task types  
- Reduced recovery time  
- Visual and audio noise  

The game pressures focus, not knowledge.

---

## 🎨 Visual Style

- Dark sci-fi theme  
- Neon highlights  
- Floating tiles  
- Subtle motion throughout  

As overload increases:

- Tiles jitter  
- Text blurs  
- Animations desynchronize  

The interface itself communicates stress.

---

## 🔊 Audio Design

- Rhythmic alert tones  
- Escalating background hum  
- Distortion under overload  

Sound is a gameplay signal — not decoration.

---

## 🏆 Scoring & Progression

Players are evaluated on:

- Alerts cleared  
- Accuracy  
- System stability duration  
- Peak overload survived  

High scores reward control, not chaos.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React / Svelte / Unity  
- **Interaction:** Mouse, keyboard, optional voice  
- **State Logic:** Central event queue + load simulation  
- **Audio:** Web Audio API / FMOD

## 🚀 Hackathon MVP Scope

### Must-Have

- Dashboard UI  
- 4–5 task tile types  
- Continuous alert queue  
- System overload meter  

### Nice-to-Have

- Voice input

---

## 🎤 One-Line Pitch

A fast sci-fi dashboard game where alerts never stop coming — and survival depends on how well you manage overload.

---

## 🧩 Final Note

COMMAND OVERLOAD looks like a chaotic task game.

It is actually a test of:

- Focus  
- Restraint  
- Cognitive endurance  

The system doesn’t beat you.  
**You overwhelm yourself.**
